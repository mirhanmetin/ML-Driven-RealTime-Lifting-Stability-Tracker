# Project Outline

### **Project Title:**

**Development of a Balance and Stability Measurement System for Powerlifting with Machine Learning Integration**

---

### **1. Introduction**

- **Overview of Powerlifting**: Briefly introduce powerlifting and its core movements: the squat, deadlift, and bench press.
- **Importance of Balance and Stability**: Explain the roles of balance and stability in ensuring safe, effective lifting and reducing injury risk.
- **Objective**: Define the primary goal of the project—to study balance and stability across powerlifting movements and use sensors to identify correct and incorrect movement patterns.

---

### **2. Project Aim**

- **Aim**: To develop a system to measure balance and stability during powerlifting exercises, tracking the distribution of weight across the feet and monitoring core stability during the bench press.

---

### **3. Project Purpose**

- **Purpose**: This project aims to develop a system to measure and analyze balance and stability during key powerlifting exercises, focusing on the bench press, squats, and deadlifts. Utilizing pressure-sensitive insoles, force platforms, or wearable IMUs, the system will track real-time weight distribution across the feet and monitor core stability to ensure optimal form and enhance performance.
- The collected data will enable athletes and trainers to identify balance shifts and stability deviations, providing actionable insights for improving lifting techniques, reducing injury risk, and maximizing training effectiveness. This tool will serve as a valuable resource for both novice and experienced powerlifters in achieving peak performance.
- A machine learning (ML) component will be integrated to analyze this data, enabling the system to identify subtle patterns in balance and stability unique to each athlete’s lifting style. By training ML models on a diverse dataset of lifting techniques (not a must) and stability profiles, the system will provide personalized feedback, detect atypical movements, and predict potential injury risks based on deviations from an athlete’s typical form.
